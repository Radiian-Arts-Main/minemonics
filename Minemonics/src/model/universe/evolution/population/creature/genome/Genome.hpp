	 * @details		The segment copying mutation replaces the entire segment specification entry in the vector with a copy of another chosen uniformly at random from the vector, but excluding the original. The new segment specification is not an exact copy of the original, but contains adjustments meant to preserve self-loops in the branching pattern of the body tree. This mutation is represented by the following pseudocode:
	 *
	 * // Inputs: SegmentSpec SS, int d, int s
	 * // SS is the segment specification to be copied
	 * //d is the destination index in the specification
	 * //s is the source index (of SS) in the specification
	 * // The destination specification is the self object whose
	 * // become_special_copy() member is called
	 * // become_special_copy (SS, d, s)
	 *	copy all real-valued parameters from SS to self
	 *	copy all integer-valued parameters from SS to self
	 *	copy all Boolean-valued parameters from SS to self
	 *	copy desired joint angle GP tree from SS to self
	 *	copy max servo torque GP tree from SS to self
	 *	copy output GP tree from SS to self
	 *	copy state GP tree from SS to self vector vector
	 * // Source segment self-referencing branches should become
	 * // destination segment self-referencing branches
	 * for b = 1 to max_branches do
	 *	if segment type index of branch b of SS = s then
	 *		set segment type index of branch b to d in self
	 *
	 * A self-loop arises when branch specifications dictate that segments of a particular type should have child segments of the same type. The segment copying mutation preserves this direct recursion in the tree structure when copying a segment specification from one index in the segment specification vector to another.

	 * @details		The 'stub' growing mutation method causes a segment to sprout a new branch which itself has no branches. Many mutations that result in new branches often produced large
	 complicated structures that, should they appear on a creature already fairly evolved, are almost always extremely detrimental. This mutation was created as a means of providing a more subtle mutation that adds complexity to a creature's morphology with what is intended to be a reduced impact on fitness. The method proceeds as follows.
	 * // Input:int i
	 * //i is the index of the segment specificationto be mutated
	 * // Let:ss[] be the vectorof segment specifications
	 *
	 * //stub-growth(i)
	 * // A segment specification other than i will also be modifiedin
	 * //this mutation, j is its index and is chosen uniformlyat
	 * // random
	 * int j = a randomly chosen segment index other than i
	 * // Since ss[j] we be a Â´stub' its max repeats will be set to one.
	 * // Since no segments should followthe repeats, the type to
	 * // to followrepeats will be set to itself
	 *
	 * max repeats for ss[j] = 1

	 * 	clearthe enable flagof ss[j]'sbranch specification #bs
	 * // Pick a branch index in ss[i] to pointto ss[j](uniform random)
	 * int k = a number from 1 to the number of branch specifications(5)
	 *
	 * // Connect segment j as a branch from segment i and enable it
	 * set the type of ss[i]'s branch #k to j
	 * set the enable flag of ss[i]'s branch #k
	 * // The 'stub' should only be a single branch, not a mirrored pair
	 * clear the mirror flag of ss[i]'s branch #k

	 * @details		The segment randomization mutation simply deletes a segment specification and replaces it with a randomly-generated one.
	 * The new segment specification is created by calling a segment specification constructor and passing it a bushiness parameter between 0.1 and 0.9, chosen uniformly at random. The bushiness parameter is used directly as the probability probability that any given branch specification in the segment specification will have its enable flag set to true instead of false. A high bushiness parameter is more likely to produce a segment with many branches.
