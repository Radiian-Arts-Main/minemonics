/**
 * @brief		The mixed genome is an genome type that encodes the morphology and the neural network in a compact/indirect encoding.
 * @details		 A creature's genotype dictates a potentially-recursive (both indirectly and directly recursive)
 * branching pattern. The genome encodes properties for a fixed number of segment types, and associated
 * with each type is a fixed number of branch specifications that dictate the way in which a segment of
 * a given type sprouts branches of other segment types. The encoded information also specifies the scaling,
 * positioning, and other aspects of the branching.
 *  * The genetic representation of this morphology is a directed graph of
 * nodes and connections. Each graph contains the developmental instructions
 * for growing a creature, and provides a way of reusing instructions to
 * make similar or recursive components within the creature. A phenotype
 * hierarchy of parts is made from a graph by starting at a defined
 * root-node and synthesizing parts from the node information while tracing
 * through the connections of the graph. The graph can be recurrent. Nodes
 * can connect to themselves or in cycles to form recursive or fractal like
 * structures. They can also connect to the same child multiple times to
 * make duplicate instances of the same appendage.

	 * //d is the destination index in the specification

	 * for b = 1 to max_branches do
	 *	if segment type index of branch b of SS = s then
	 *		set segment type index of branch b to d in self
	 *
	 * A self-loop arises when branch specifications dictate that segments of a particular type should have child segments of the same type. The segment copying mutation preserves this direct recursion in the tree structure when copying a segment specification from one index in the segment specification vector to another.

	 * @details		The 'stub' growing mutation method causes a segment to sprout a new branch which itself has no branches. Many mutations that result in new branches often produced large
	 complicated structures that, should they appear on a creature already fairly evolved, are almost always extremely detrimental. This mutation was created as a means of providing a more subtle mutation that adds complexity to a creature's morphology with what is intended to be a reduced impact on fitness. The method proceeds as follows.

	 * // Let:ss[] be the vector of segment specifications
	 *
	 * //stub-growth(i)

	 * //this mutation, j is its index and is chosen uniformly at
	 * // random
	 * int j = a randomly chosen segment index other than i
	 * // Since ss[j] we be a Â´stub' its max repeats will be set to one.
	 * // Since no segments should follow the repeats, the type to
	 * // to follow repeats will be set to itself
	 *
	 * max repeats for ss[j] = 1
	 * type to follow repeats for ss[j] = j

	 * // Disable all branches extending from segments of type j

	 * int k = a number from 1 to the number of branch specifications(5)
	 *
	 * // Connect segment j as a branch from segment i and enable it
	 * set the type of ss[i]'s branch #k to j
	 * set the enable flag of ss[i]'s branch #k
	 * // The 'stub' should only be a single branch, not a mirrored pair
