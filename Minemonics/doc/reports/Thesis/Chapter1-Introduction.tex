\section{Relating adaptability and locomotion}

Motion is a central aspect of life for organisms on earth. In order to survive and be competitive in the endless development of evolution, one has to be highly adaptive on all levels from the microscopic level of the DNA to the macroscopic level of the morphology of an organism. The adaptability of an organism permits it to find a niche, live in it and adapt to it in order to simplify the exploitation of the niche's environment. Except for primary producers that have found a way to be adaptable completely without self-generated motion and mainly relying on environmental forces such as wind or water to distribute seeds, organisms of higher complexity such as vertebrates, without exception, depend on locomotion, usually the most complex motor behavior it performs \cite{bib:Grillner2000}. Since higher complexity in general needs more space and therefore these organisms are larger than those of lower complexity, it does not suffice to rely on environmental forces to relocate. The ability to locomote enables an organism to extend the size of its current niche or to move to another niche if the attractivity of its current niche is reduced due a strong competitor or due to environmental changes. Locomotion is therefore a key component to adaptive organisms. However, depending on the medium locomotion takes place in, it is hard to keep it stable. In water, fluid streams can prevent an organism from moving into one direction stably. On land, an organism faces problems with different obstacles and appropriate foot placement or switching between different gait patterns. How nature solves these problems is largely unknown, recent papers mainly focus on computationally expensive engineering solutions into which we will look in the next section.

\section{The engineering approach on locomotion}


Recent work shows experimental evidence that fishes for instance exploit fluidal vortices to reduce locomotory costs ( Müller \cite{bib:Muller2003}, Liao et al. \cite{bib:Liao2003a,bib:Liao2003b}).

\section{A more natural approach}

Locomotion in animals seems solve the problem of getting from point A to point B extremely easily and elegantly. Even under constraints of rough terrain and obstacles interfering with the goal, a solution is nearly always found and does generally not include a long planning time. On the other hand, engineering solutions usually rely on a longer planning times and still do not reach competitive solutions in term of leg placement and adaptability to the environment. Conventionally, the need for adaption has to be detected and then a new gait or leg position has to be calculated. Using a system that adaptively produces a variety of periodic movements, the calculation intensive controller could be replaced by the periodic controller. The interaction of the body and the controller with the environment automatically constrain the motion space of the legs in order to make the creature move forward. An example of periodicity generating controller is a chaotic, dynamical system that gets controlled using simple limiter control. The sensors from the joints as well as the weight, shape and inertia of the limbs act as limiters. The goal of the thesis is to use evolutionary algorithms and an example of genotype to phenotype transcription to let creatures evolve in a rigid-body engine to show examples of evolved creatures that use the above described system to move on different kinds of ground and adapt its movement depending on the ground.

\subsection{Evolutionary Algorithms}

Evolutionary algorithms mimic the general way of how evolution as a self-optimizing process finds competitive individuals able to survive on earth. The general approach is based on a population of individuals, each individual based on a genotype, an element defining the characteristics of the individual. The genotype is the blueprint of the animal and subject to variation through mutation and crossover. The fitness functions, which model the environmental constraints that define what has to be achieved in order to be called fit, are applied to all individuals of the population to measure their fitness. If an individual is competitive with respect to the fitness functions, it has a higher chance to reproduce than a non-competitive individual. This means that the genotypes of individuals with high fitness values then are crossed, which forms a new genotype which is a mixture of the parent's genotypes. All individuals are subject to one or multiple types of mutations, which lead to slight changes in the genotype, thereby also leading to changes in the fitness of that individual. In order to keep the size of the population constant, some of the worst performing individuals are culled. Using this process, approximately optimal solutions to NP-complete problems can be found such as the travelling salesman problem [?look at Ruedi's notes]. This is due to the features of the variation operators, crossover leading to mixtures of different solutions which possibly are better solutions than the crossed solutions, and mutation helping to avoid getting stuck in local minima. It must be noted that the process per se does not aim to generate better individuals and that variational operations do not necessarily lead to a better fitness of an individual, but the population under the evolutionary process will adapt to the fitness landscape and very fit individuals will arise from it, not necessarily showing the same or even similar solution depending on the complexity of the fitness landscape (defining the number of peaks in the fitness landscape). 

Locomotion could be a challenging optimization task for evolution as the fitness landscape is very non-continuous. The lack of symmetry for instance, constituting a simple change in some genome structures, strongly influences the locomotion performance, as the creature loses a symmetric limb, making it much harder to walk properly due to the imbalance.

\subsection{Chaotic systems as a source of high variability}

Chaotic systems are systems underlying many different physical processes such as the three-body problem in astronomy studied by Poincaré \cite{bib:Poincare1892}, population models in biology studied by Verhulst \cite{bib:Verhulst1838}, weather models in meteorology studied by Lorenz \cite{bib:Lorenz1963} and many other models from different other fields. Before the beginning of chaos theory dated back to the 19th century, it was thought that approximate knowledge was sufficient to approximate the knowledge about the future. In natural sciences, the exact knowledge of a real-world state of a system is impossible, as the real-valued nature of the natural, continuous system state have infinite precision. However an experiment can only reveal a limited-precision state of the system. Chaos theory showed that a small variation of the initial conditions causes a large variation in the final prediction, as already Poincaré put it in his studies when studying the three-body problem. The former belief that deterministic systems can be perfectly predicted turned out wrong for most systems \cite{bib:Motter2013}. The same property, namely the sensitivity to the initial conditions can be used to produce a high variability of trajectories. In a chaotic system, the trajectories are guided by an infinite amount of unstable periodic orbits(UPOs), that in interaction with each other lead to the variability of trajectories. If it could be achieved that through a chaotic system, different initial conditions and a third component to control the system that the system would exhibit different periodic and chaotic trajectories, the system could be tuned through evolutionary algorithms to show a desired solution trajectory to simplify the emergence of locomotion. As it turns out, simple limiters, introduced in the next section, are a very natural way of influencing chaotic systems, and therefore, through their innate coupling with the chaotic system as expressed in the same 'language' as the system and hence elegant by simplicity, could be the key to control the system into different trajectories for periodic and chaotic movement.
