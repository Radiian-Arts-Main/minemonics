\section{Relating adaptability and locomotion}

Motion is a central aspect of life for organisms on earth. In order to survive and be competitive in the endless development of evolution, one has to be highly adaptive on all levels from the microscopic level of the DNA to the macroscopic level of the morphology of an organism. The adaptability of an organism permits it to find a niche, live in it and adapt to it in order to simplify the exploitation the environment of the niche. Primary producers have found a way to be adaptable completely without self-generated motion, usually growing and living in one specific spot without the possibility of relocation, mainly relying on environmental forces such as wind or water to distribute seeds. Combined with an r-selection strategy living in an unstable environment, this might be a valid approach to quickly spread within and dominate a certain niche. For organisms of higher complexity, however, it might not suffice to rely on environmental forces to relocate. The ability to locomote enables an organism to move to another environment if the attractivity of its current environment is reduced due to environmental changes or due a strong competitor. // If a population of organisms finds a .Locomotion apparently

\subsection{Evolutionary Algorithms}

Evolutionary algorithms mimic the general way of how evolution as a self-optimizing process finds competitive individuals able to survive on earth. The general approach is based on a population of individuals, each based on a genotype, an element defining the characteristics of the individual. The genotype is the blueprint of the animal and subject to variation through mutation and crossover. The fitness functions, which model the environmental constraints that define what has to be achieved in order to be called fit, are applied to all individuals of the population to measure their fitness. If an individual is competitive with respect to the fitness functions, it has a higher chance to reproduce than a non-competitive individual. This means that the genotypes of individuals with high fitness values then are crossed, which forms a new genotype which is a mixture of the parent's genotypes. All individuals are subject to one or multiple types of mutations, which lead to slight changes in the genotype, thereby also leading to changes in the fitness of that individual. In order to keep the size of the population constant, some of the non-competitive individuals are culled. Using this process, nearly optimal solutions can be found to very complicated problems can be found such as the travelling salesman problem [?look at Ruedi's notes]. This is due to the features of the variation operators, crossover leading to mixtures of different solutions which possibly are a better solution than the crossed solutions, and mutation helping to avoid getting stuck in local minima. It must be noted that the process per se does not aim to generate better individuals and that variating does not necessarily lead to a better fitness of an individual, but the population under an evolutionary process will adapt to the fitness landscape and very fit individuals will ...
