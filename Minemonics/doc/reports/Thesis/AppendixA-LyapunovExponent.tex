The divergence of gait performance can be measured using the Largest Lyapunov exponent, the mean rate of separation of trajectories, and calculated with the following form adapted from \cite{bib:Rosenstein1993}. %
%
Given the chaotic system in the form below, so that the iterated function applied \(t\) times to \(x_0\) results in \(x(t)\), the same holds for a perturbance \(\delta x_0\) which after t iterations occurs as \(\delta x(t)\).

\begin{align*}
x(t) = f^t(x_0)\\
x(t) + \delta x(t) = f^t(x_0 + \delta x_0)\\
\end{align*}

To measure the sensitivity to the initial conditions, the evolution of the perturbance \(\delta x_0\) through the system can be calculated:

\[||\delta x(t)|| = \||\delta x_0|| e^{\lambda\ t}\]

The \(\lambda\) in that case is also called the Largest Lyapunov exponent (LLE). %
%
If \(\lambda\ > 0\), then the trajectory diverges exponentially. %
%
A \(\lambda\ = 0\) means, that the system is in a critical state, because its trajectories neither diverge nor converge. %
%
However, if \(\lambda\ < 0\), it expresses the convergence of a trajectory to a stable point or orbit. %
%
The quantification would be done by plotting the Log ratio of the divergence:

\[\log\left(\frac{||\delta x(t)||}{||\delta x_0||}\right) = \lambda\ t\]
%
The LLE can then be found by line fitting segments of the time evolution log plot of the trajectory differences and by measuring the slope of the lines. %
