Although animals living in fluid environments commonly capture energy from vortices, experimental data on the hydrodynamics and neural control of interactions between fish and vortices are lacking. We used quantitative flow visualization and electromyography to show that trout will adopt a novel mode of locomotion to slalom in between experimentally generated vortices by activating only their anterior axial muscles. Reduced muscle activity during vortex exploitation compared with the activity of fishes engaged in undulatory swimming suggests a decrease in the cost of locomotion and provides a mechanism to understand the patterns of fish distributions in schools and riverine environments.},

	abstract = {Most fishes commonly experience unsteady flows and hydrodynamic perturbations during their lifetime. In this study, we provide evidence that rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss voluntarily alter their body kinematics when interacting with vortices present in the environment that are not self-generated. To demonstrate this, we measured axial swimming kinematics in response to changes in known hydrodynamic wake characteristics. We compared trout swimming in the K{\'a}rm{\'a}n street behind different diameter cylinders (2.5 and 5 cm) at two flow speeds (2.5 and 4.5 L s-1, where L is total body length) to trout swimming in the free stream and in the cylinder bow wake. Trout swimming behind cylinders adopt a distinctive, previously undescribed pattern of movement in order to hold station, which we term the K{\'a}rm{\'a}n gait. During this gait, body amplitudes and curvatures are much larger than those of trout swimming at an equivalent flow velocity in the absence of a cylinder. Tail-beat frequency is not only lower than might be expected for a trout swimming in the reduced flow behind a cylinder, but also matches the vortex shedding frequency of the cylinder. Therefore, in addition to choosing to be in the slower flow velocity offered behind a cylinder (drafting), trout are also altering their body kinematics to synchronize with the shed vortices (tuning), using a mechanism that may not involve propulsive locomotion. This behavior is most distinctive when cylinder diameter is large relative to fish length. While tuning, trout have a longer body wavelength than the prescribed wake wavelength, indicating that only certain regions of the body may need to be oriented in a consistent manner to the oncoming vortices. Our results suggest that fish can capture energy from vortices generated by the environment to maintain station in downstream flow. Interestingly, trout swimming in front of a cylinder display lower tail-beat amplitudes and body wave speeds than trout subjected to any of the other treatments, implying that the bow wake may be the most energetically favorable region for a fish to hold station near a cylinder.},

	abstract = {The central pattern generator for locomotion in the spinal cord of the lamprey can be activated in vitro by the addition of D-glutamate to the bathing saline. Serotonin has no effects when bath-applied alone, but it modulates the D-glutamate-activated swimming pattern. Three major effects are observed: a dose-dependent reduction in the frequency of rhythmic ventral root burst discharge; enhancement of the intensity of burst discharge, due in part to the recruitment of previously inactive motoneurones; prolongation of the intersegmental phase lag. Motoneurone activation appears to result from enhanced synaptic drive from the central pattern generator; no direct effects of serotonin on the motoneurones themselves (resting potential, input resistance or threshold for action potential generation) were observed. Theoretical and experimental studies suggest that the prolongation of the intersegmental phase lag results at least in part from differential effects of serotonin on segmental oscillators in different parts of the spinal cord. Isolated caudal pieces of the cord were more strongly affected by serotonin than isolated rostral pieces. We propose that serotonin may be an endogenous modulator of the central pattern generator for locomotion in the lamprey. It may have a role in the generation of a family of related undulatory movements (swimming, crawling, burrowing) by a single central pattern generator.},

In this article, I will review research carried out on locomotor central pattern generators (CPGs), i.e. neural circuits capable of producing coordinated patterns of high-dimensional rhythmic output signals while receiving only simple, low-dimensional, input signals. The review will first cover neurobiological observations concerning locomotor \{CPGs\} and their numerical modelling, with a special focus on vertebrates. It will then cover how \{CPG\} models implemented as neural networks or systems of coupled oscillators can be used in robotics for controlling the locomotion of articulated robots. The review also presents how robots can be used as scientific tools to obtain a better understanding of the functioning of biological CPGs. Finally, various methods for designing \{CPGs\} to control specific modes of locomotion will be briefly reviewed. In this process, I will discuss different types of \{CPG\} models, the pros and cons of using \{CPGs\} with robots, and the pros and cons of using robots as scientific tools. Open research topics both in biology and in robotics will also be discussed.}
