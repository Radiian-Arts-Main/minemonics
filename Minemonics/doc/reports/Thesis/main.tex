\textbf{Motivation.} The evolution of locomotion was of central importance for the spread of the first complex life in the ocean and the transition from the ocean to land. %
%
Locomotion is omnipresent in simple and complex organisms of micro and macroscopic level, thus there must exist an underlying natural process that simplifies its emergence. %
%
When observing a variety of locomotion gait patterns in nature, it becomes obvious how robust animal gaits are against perturbations. %
%
Therefore the underlying system has to be adaptive to the quickly changing environment locomotion takes place in. %
%
Unfortunately, our understanding of the fundamental process of adaptive gaits is still limited. %
%
In robotic applications, locomotion implemented using computationally expensive planning methods often fails to copy the delicate behavior of animals, especially when it comes to keeping locomotion robust and adaptive in unpredictable situations. %
%
The difference might be that robot locomotion often relies on a large sensory interface to sense the environment and an internal model to plan the next actuation of the limbs based on the current state of movement. %
%
Natural walking however relies on central pattern generators (CPG), which emit oscillatory signals to control and coordinate limb movement. %
%
It has been shown that the pyloric central pattern generators of the spiny lobster are closed neural systems that undergo chaotic oscillations \cite{bib:Rabinovich1997}. %
%
We hypothesize that the underlying natural process to simplify the emergence of adaptive, oscillatory movement in locomotion patterns are chaotic systems, which are controlled into different periodicities and adapt their oscillation frequency based on feedback from the environment. %
%
The adaptive system consists not only of the central pattern generator, though; the whole complex of pattern generators, the limbs and the connecting joints all work together to self-adapt to the external constraints. \\
%
%
%
\textbf{Methods.} This work focusses on finding examples of locomoting, simulated creatures that use chaotic systems to control periodic leg movement. %
%
Therefore, an example chaotic system was chosen, the Chua circuit, to be controlled by a chaos control method called simple limiter control \cite{bib:Corron2000}. %
%
The limiting component, the simple limiter, can be set appropriately so that the chaotic system presents chaotic and periodic trajectories. %
%
Furthermore, a simulator was implemented to evolve simple creatures in a rigid-body physics engine using an evolutionary process, a terrestrial flat plane environment, and a genome and phenotype structure to encode a morphology out of 3D primitives (such as boxes and capsules) connected by joints and a controller structure using the chaotic system. %
%
To compare the results of evolution using chaotic controllers, reference simulations were performed using a sinusoidal controller. %
%
Some preliminary experiments were performed to replicate the simple limiter control method and explore the influence of soft limiters and different limiter configurations on the behavior of the Chua circuit. %
%
Then a chaotic controller was configured with different limiters by the movement of the joint of a simple model leg. %
%
The model leg was set up in different settings: gravity-less space and interacting with ground, additionally with different joint torques and damping settings. %
%
Finally, the evolution simulator was run to evolve locomoting creatures on land using the chaotic controller. \\
%
%
%
\textbf{Results.} The simple limiter control method benefits from soft limiters in the sense that the simple limiter parameter ranges of different stabilized limit cycles are increased. %
%
Furthermore, under which conditions the simple limiter is applied to which part of the system plays an important role in the success of the control method and must be chosen wisely. %
%
In the simulation of the model leg, only limit cycles of periodicity 1 could be found. In the absence of gravitation, the model leg always converged to the limit cycle. %
%
In the interaction with ground, smaller limit cycles were stabilized, but the system tried to converge back to the uninfluenced larger limit cycle. %
%
It was found that damping leads to sub-manifolds of the original manifold described by the limit cycle. %
%
The increased joint torque leads to a larger limit cycle, however, contrary to expectations, does not make the system switch to a higher periodicity in either the controller or joint phase space. %
%
The evolution simulator successfully evolved creatures using both the sinusoidal and the chaotic controllers. %
%
In the case of the creatures using the chaotic controllers, a more in-depth analysis of the trajectories showed that higher periodicity can be observed both in the controller and joint phase space. %

I would like to thank Professor Ruedi Stoop for his patience, numerous advices and kind critique. I am very grateful for all the support, discussions and material I was provided by the Stoop group, especially I want to thank Thomas Lorimer and Karlis Kanders for their help with the implementation the chaotic model and limiter control, the interpretation of the data and the helpful discussions leading to different improvements of this Thesis. In addition I want to thank my girlfriend Perrine Dubuis for her support during my studies and work on my Thesis, without which I would not have had the same patience for the countless failed experiments and evolutionary runs without usable results. Furthermore, I want to thank Randolph Busch for proof-reading this Thesis and for finding inconsistencies in reasoning and explanations.
