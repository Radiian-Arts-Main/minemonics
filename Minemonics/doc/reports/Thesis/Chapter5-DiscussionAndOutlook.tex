%
An artificial evolution simulator is developed to evolve virtual three dimensional creatures built from rigid-body primitives. %
%
The simulator features the evaluation of one or multiple populations in different environmental and evolutional settings. %
%
Different fitness functions can be combined with weights and the fitness landscape can be changed during the evolutionary run. %
%
The simulations can be stopped and continued later with little effort. %
%
The creatures can be manipulated during their evaluation and their internal controller and joint dynamics can be observed in real-time. %
%
The interface features various possibilities to log the data to file, so that further processing of the data is simplified. 

Creatures were evolved using two different, distributed controller structures, a non-adaptive sinusoidal controller and a newly introduced adaptive chaotic system controller. %
%
In order to develop the chaotic controller, it was necessary to understand the dynamics to be expected when limiting a chaotic system with the limiter chaos control method. %
%
Therefore, the findings of the simple limiter chaos control method introduced in \cite{bib:Corron2000} with the example model of the Chua circuit \cite{bib:Matsumoto1985} were confirmed and extended by the use of a tunable soft-limiter. %
%
Additionally, two different limiter configurations and their range of different periodic orbits were analyzed. %
%
It was found that a soft-limiter expands the size of each range of periodic orbit and therefore makes it easier to achieve a stable orbit. %
%
The chaotic controller internally controls an underlying chaotic model system into chaotic and periodic trajectories using a variation of the simple limiter chaos control method. %
%
The simple limiter hereby is applied through a coupling with the controlled joint DoF by feeding the joint position and velocity output back into the chaotic controller, replacing the original state with the sensor values. %
%
Therefore, the chaotic controller faces a limiter if the joint faces an external limiter imposed through the environment. %
%
Limited by this external load, the chaotic system changes its internal dynamics to cope with the new load. %
%
The evolutionary algorithm in this context composes different creatures to find a morphology and appropriate internal control parameters which exploit the internal chaotic dynamics of the controller in such a way that together they show basic locomotion behavior. %
%
For both controllers, successful creatures could be evolved showing various ways to locomote. %
%
Most importantly, it could be shown that using an arbitrarily chosen chaotic system and a simple limiter varying its limitation of the state space depending on the external constraints from the environment, different adaptive locomotion patterns can arise, which are robust to external disturbances. %
%
For the adaptive chaotic controller, it could be shown that different leg dynamics are emerging depending on the external load of the environment. %
%
This could be shown in a hand-made model organism as well as in several evolved creatures, that showed different leg dynamics when lifted off the ground than when left on ground to locomote. %
%
In experiments with the hand-made model leg, featuring one single joint connecting two limbs, different periodic orbits could be stabilized. %
%
The influence of different morphological parameters could be observed. %
%
Applying higher or lower amounts of joint torque increases or decreases the orbit diameter respectively, damping leads to a sub-manifold of the orbit. %
%
However, in all cases the joint converges to a proper periodic orbit.

An issue confronted with during the simulation run was that no fitness function used in the experiments accounted for gait efficiency, therefore, some creatures considered fit by the fitness functions in use did not perform an efficient locomotion gait. %
%
The simulation additionally has a general tendency to come up with very messy creature morphologies exploiting oscillations of large amplitude, which would require large amounts of energy to keep up the resulting locomotion. %
%
An improvement to address this issue would be that a creature had an amount of energy to spend proportional to its size or weight, so that a creature could not waste an excessive amount of energy on inefficient movements. 

Another issue to address in the future would be the configuration of the limiter. %
%
The current simple limiter was evaluated experimentally to stabilize a periodic orbit, which is an indication that the limiter is applied to the system. %
%
This could be addressed by a less restricting application of the sensory feedback, such as that a higher limb velocity would reduce the size of the phase space of the chaotic system, so that dynamics of lower periodicity would arise. %
%
However, it is in question how to design the limiter, because as soon as a certain intention of desired outcome is behind a certain configuration of the limiter, one builds a limiter into the chaotic system such that it shows a specific, desired result. %
%
Therefore the choice of an appropriate limiter configuration is a particularly hard task.

A future experiment could be to actually measure the chaoticity of the controller and joint dynamics. %
%
Preliminary results suggest that the controller could be an intermittent system switching back and forth between chaotic and periodic phases. %
%
An experiment to measure the chaoticity would involve a successfully locomoting creature's controllers to be perturbed using a small perturbation. %
%
If the controller is stabilized on a periodic orbit, the trajectory then would be moved away by the perturbation, but finally converge back onto the limit cycle. %
%
However, if the controller is not stabilized, the trajectory would diverge exponentially from the original, unperturbed trajectory and never return. %
%
The divergence of convergence behavior could be measured using the Largest Lyapunov exponent, the mean rate of separation of trajectories, calculated with the following form adapted from \cite{bib:Rosenstein1993}:

\begin{align*}
x(t) = f^t(x_0)\\
x(t) + \delta x(t) = f^t(x_0 + \delta x_0)\\
\end{align*}

To measure the sensitivity to the initial conditions, we can now calculate the evolution of the perturbance \(\delta x_0\) through the system:

\[||\delta x(t)|| = \||\delta x_0|| e^{\mu t}\]

The \(\mu\) in that case is also called the largest Lyapunov exponent (LLE).%
%
If \(\mu > 0\), then the trajectory diverges exponentially. %
%
A \(\mu = 0\) means, that the system is in a critical state, because its trajectories neither diverge nor converge. %
%
However, if \(\mu < 0\), it expresses the convergence of a trajectory to a stable point or orbit. %
%
The quantification would be done by plotting the Log divergence distance ratio:

\[\log\left(\frac{||\delta x(t)||}{||\delta x_0||}\right) = \mu t\]
%
The LLE can then be found by fitting segments of the time evolution log plot of the of the trajectory differences. 

The perturbation can be automatically performed using the simulator by enabling automatic perturbance. %
%
The preliminary results, suggesting that the chaotic controller is an intermittent system, raise the question at which point during the evaluation the perturbation should be applied. %
%
Given that the creature starts above ground and falls onto it first, the best guess would be to perturb the creature after it has stabilized on ground and begun to perform its locomotion gait. %
%
A perturbation before the collision with the ground might be swallowed by the larger perturbation of the collision, obfuscating the actual results. %
