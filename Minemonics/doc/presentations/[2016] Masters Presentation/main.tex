%General Remarks
%- Tell a story i.e. build your presentation around a small set of messages you want to communicate. Think about what you want to tell.
%- Tailor your presentation to your audience. How much do they know - what needs to be explained and what not? What are they interested in?
%- Make sure that the main messages of your slides can also be understood by a deaf person following your presentation
%- Don’t put too much text on your slides. Stick with short messages

%Animations
%- It’s a scientific presentation so only use subtle animations (no motion, no blinking)

%Structure
%- Make sure that you guide the eye of the viewer to the things you want to communicate
%- Distribute your content among slides rather than overfilling one
%- Make the content appear step by step to guide the viewer through it (Animations - Fade In)
%- Do not use background images or strong background colors
%- If you have a date on your slides, make sure it is correct
%- Don’t put logos in the footer of your slides

%Fonts
%- The fonts have to be big enough be be readable even from far away - min. 20 pt (also for figure captions)
%- Comic sans is the right font for birthday cards but not for presentations

%Figures
%- Make sure the axes are labeled correctly and they have to be readable

%Hint: Display your talk on your laptop. Now walk to the other side of the room. Can you still read everything?

%Slide Titles
%- The title should be short and descriptive: What is the content of the slide?
%- Substantives have to be upper case in a title

%Headers / Footers
%- Put numbers on your slides so that people with questions car refer to them
%- Keep your headers and footers as minimal as possible otherwise they are distractors. At ISSCC for example, all logos, footers etc are BANNED.

%Movies / Live Demos
%- If you have movies of your work - show them!
%- If you have demos of your work, you first have to make sure that they run under the given conditions. Do not rely on them to work. Avoid showing demos that do not run robustly. If your demo is not reliably working, take a movie.

%########################
%Introduction
%- After a short Welcome, the audience has to be introduced to the question which you are going to answer in the talk or the story you are going to tell. Why is what you you present of relevance?
%- For longer talks, it is better to start with an overview slide that explains the structure of the talk
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%Introduction:
%-Locomotion
%-Classical example
%-Simplifying control through simple limits
%-Problem statement
\subfile{sections/Introduction/Introduction.tex}

%Use experiments overview and highlight /focus current experiment


%########################
%Methods
%- After the Introduction you explain what you did
%########################
%Results
%- As soon as the audience knows what you did, you show them what you got
%- Quantify in a understandable way - explain your measures


%Chaotic Systems:
%-Introduction
%-Chua circuit
%-Simple limiter
%-Manipulatable example

%Mathematica experiments:
%-Overview slide with the plots highlighted one by one

%Minemonics -  3D Virtual Creature Simulator:
%-Early work (Picture with Ninja, because every picture contains an invisible Ninja)
%-Genotypes, Phenotypes and Embryogenesis
%-Evolution, Fitness and the Reaper
%-Numerical Physics Simulations and Problems

%########################
%Discussion
%- Discuss what you got
\subfile{sections/Discussion/Discussion.tex}

%########################
%Conclusion
%- Contextualize and summon your findings
%- Refer back to your introduction
%- Sell your findings to the audience - everyone should walk out of the room with the good feeling that they learned something
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%Conclusion: (Always add picture to underline the conclusions)
%-Soft limiters simplify the stabilization of periodic orbits
%-In the model leg, joint damping, joint driving force and ground limiter were explored
%-Creature using the sinusoidal and directly limited chaotic controller could be evolved
%-Controllers based on an arbitrarily chosen chaotic system and varying state space limitation through a simple limiter can cause different adaptive locomotion gait patterns to emerge.
%-Varying limiters make the leg dynamics vary, an indication of a change of the applied limiters
\subfile{sections/Conclusion/Conclusion.tex}

%########################
%Outlook
%- Present the next steps
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%-Gait efficiency fitness using an energy function
%-Gait stability to perturbations using the Largest Lyapunov Exponent
%-Evolutionary variation of joint driving force as another limiter
\subfile{sections/Outlook/Outlook.tex}

%Acknowledgements
%- Thank your colleagues 
%- Thank the funding institutions for the money
%- Thank the audience for their attention (not necessary for conferences)
%- If you put pictures of the main contributors of the presented work on the acknowledgement slide, it’s easier for the audience to associate them to the work presented.
%- It’s also fair and sometimes even mandatory to mention your funding institutions (incl. logo?) on one of the last slides
\subfile{sections/Acknowledgements/Acknowledgements.tex}

%########################
%Backup Slides
%- Keep some supplementary material on backup slides to reply on questions on content which you were not capable of presenting (due to the restricted time)

Please use no more then two of them in your presentation. The first two (counted from the left hand side) are reserved for the administration chapter of the ETHZ (first one for external presentation, second for internal), all others you can freely choose.
