==========

An open-source 3D virtual creature evolution simulator built with OGRE rendering engine in C++. For the Evolutionary Algorithm Shark machine learning is used, furthermore MathGL for graph plotting, Bullet for the physics and Boost for loggin and testing. In the future, a library for Deep neural networks will also be needed.
