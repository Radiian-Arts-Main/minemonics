==========

An open-source 3D virtual creature evolution simulator built with OGRE3D rendering engine in C++. For the Evolutionary Algorithm Shark machine learning will probably be used, furthermore MathGL (http://mathgl.sourceforge.net/doc_en/Website.html) and Igraph (http://igraph.org) for graph plotting, FFmpeg (https://www.ffmpeg.org/) for capturing video, Bullet3 for the physics and Boost for logging and testing. In the future, a library for Deep neural networks will also be needed.

Several aspects are taken with reference from Karl Sims (http://www.karlsims.com/) original paper called: ["Artificial Evolution for Computer Graphics"](http://www.karlsims.com/papers/siggraph91.html). But it is not a replication of that. Other aspects are taken with reference from [Lee Graham' 3D Virtual Creature Evolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_Virtual_Creature_Evolution). But it is not a replication of that either. It just contains some aspects from each of them which I found to be very intelligently chosen.
