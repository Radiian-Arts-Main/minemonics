An open-source 3D virtual creature evolution simulator built with OGRE rendering engine in C++. For the Evolutionary Algorithm Shark machine learning is used, furthermore MathGL for graph plotting, Bullet for the physics and Boost for loggin and testing. In the future, a library for Deep neural networks will also be needed.

Several aspects are taken with reference from Karl Sims (http://www.karlsims.com/) original paper called: ["Artificial Evolution for Computer Graphics"](http://www.karlsims.com/papers/siggraph91.html). But it is not a replication of that. Other aspects are taken with reference from [Lee Graham' 3D Virtual Creature Evolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_Virtual_Creature_Evolution). But it is not a replication of that either. It just contains some aspects from each of them which I found to be very intelligently chosen.
